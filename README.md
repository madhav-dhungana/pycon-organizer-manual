# PyCon Organizer Manual

RTD for organizing the yearly Python Conference in the Philippines (PyConPH)

For the first 2 PyCons (PyCon 2012 and [PyCon 2014](http://pycon-2014.python.ph/)), we sort of went on a "think on your feet" mode and relied heavily on email/IRC/slack for communicating stuff. It takes a while for people to get into context and we don't avoid repeating ourselves. The purpose of this manual is to address volunteer concerns such as:

- "I signed up for the X committee, but Iâ€™m not sure where to proceed."
- "I'm a committee head, what are my responsibilities?"
- etc.

In here you may also find a list of contact points and links to some useful resources for volunteering for PyConPH.

Excited to contribute for PyCon? Great! You're awesome! You may start by reading [this manual](https://github.com/pythonph/pycon-organizer-manual/wiki) :)

This is a living document and will be updated as needed. This is not intended to be the definite guide, but is meant to be the foundational groundwork that will inspire you in working with the community.
